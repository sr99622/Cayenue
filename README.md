<h2>Take your security seriously.</h2>

Collect, analyze and store AV streams from a fleet of networked cameras in real time. Reduce cognitive load to enhance phenomena observability using nueral net feedback indicators. Concurrently review events in critical alert situations with intuitive controls. Distributed knowledge using proxy service multipliers. Absolute autonomy over data privacy.

<h3>System Requirements</h3>

Onvif compliant cameras. Brands known to work with this system: Dahua, Hikvision, Amcrest, Trendnet, Reolink, Axis, Vivotek, Speco

Computers running Linux, Mac or Windows. Cayenue runs as both the server and the client. Linux and Mac are recommended for the server. To run YOLO inference on camera streams, a capable compute unit is required. Supported GPUs include Intel iGPU, NVIDIA and Mac Silicon. Excellent results are acheived with Intel Xe graphics and Apple M series chips. These compute units offer excellent power consumption profiles, strong performance and are supported directly by the installers for zero configuration.

<h3>Network Configuration</h3>

Cayenue supports complete camera isolation with proxy services. The cameras are unable to access either your own network or the internet at large. This is a critical feature for privacy that protects your installation and data.

Recordings are stored locally and shareable from the server for access by client computers. Configure the server for SMB protocol and pull video with the integrated file browser from any supported OS.

<h3>Searchable Video Database</h3>

Events triggered by the YOLO detector are stored as images that can be linked to the Video library. Simply double click the picture to start the timelime playback. Specific time points in video files can be accessed using the search tool. Important functions have associated key bindings for mouseless operation.

<h3>Expand Your Horizon</h3>

Open source software written in Python with the permissive Apache license gives you the ability to craft your own algorithm for advance usage.
